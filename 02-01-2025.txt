FAQ: What are the issues with JavaScript?
Ans:
    - Not strongly Typed.
    - It is not implicitly Strictly Typed
    - It is not an OOP language, It supports only few features of OOP.
    - No dynamic polymorphism
    - No code level security
    - Extensibility issues


- TypeScript is a strictly typed super set of JavaScript.
- "Anders Hejlberg" of Microsoft designed the typescript architecture. [ C# & TypeScript]
- TypeScript is built with typescript.
- It can directly interact with hardware services.
- It is a OOP language that can build large scale applications.


Features:
- It is strongly typed.
- It is strictly typed.
- It is an OOP language.
- It is built in typescript.
- It is native to OS services.
- It is faster and light weight.


Note: TypeScript is trans compiled into JavaScript. It is not a replacement for JavaScript.
        It is an alternative for JavaScript.



TypeScript Architecture:

1. TypeScript Core Compiler

    core.ts     : It verifies the entry point and loads basic library.

    programme.ts    : It checks the syntax and keywords.

    parser.ts       : It is responsible for converting the data type.

    check.ts        : It is responsible for verifying the data type.
    
    scanner.ts      : It handles input.

    emitter.ts      : It handle output.



2. Standalone TS Compiler

    tsc.ts      : It translates the TypeScript code into JavaScript.


3. Language Service

    services.ts     : It provides a pre-defined business logic.
                    It contains a factory of values and functions for TypeScript language.


4. TS Server

    server.ts       : It is responsible for hosting TS application.
                    It can listen to the request and send response.


5. VS Shim

    shims.ts        : It makes TypeScript platform neutral.
                    It can run everywhere, any device & any platform.


6. Managed Language Service

    - It is a service understandable to all OS services.
    - Unmanaged code is OS specific.
    - Managed code is cross platform.
            


Install TypeScript

    C:\> npm install -g typescript

    C:\> tsc -v     [ 5x ]


Create TypeScript Project:

1. Create a new folder for Project

    E:\typescript

2. Open in VS Code

3. Run the following command

    > tsc --init

4. It generate "tsconfig.json", which is a typescript configuration file.

5. Add a new ts file

    index.ts

    console.log("Welcome to TS");

6. Trans compile

    >tsc index.ts   => generates index.js

7. Run index.js using node Compiler

    > node index.js
